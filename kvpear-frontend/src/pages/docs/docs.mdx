# Overview
KV Pear is a simple key-value storage with a REST interface. Key-value pairs are grouped together in "buckets" which allow logical separation of data. The value in a key-value pair can be any string, integer or boolean value and will be stored as such. The simplicity of the API makes it a powerful tool with many potentially use-cases.

<h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>
<Spacer height={1} />
KV Pear uses API key authentication to verify requests. You can create your API keys in the [dashboard](/api-keys) section. API keys are action-scoped, and can be given read, write and delete permissions. For example, you may want to create a key that can only read values, or a key that can only write values. You can also create a key that can create and list buckets, but not delete it. This allows you to create keys with the minimum permissions required for your application.
To authenticate a request, pass your API key in the `x-api-key` header.
**All requests must include an API key.**

<h1 id="buckets">Buckets</h1>

<h2 id="create-bucket">Create your bucket</h2>
<EndpointLabel method="POST" path="/v1/buckets" />
Buckets are the top level of the KV Pear hierarchy. They are used to group related data together. Buckets are created using the `POST` method on the `/buckets` endpoint. The name of the bucket is passed as the request body. The bucket name must be unique to your account and can only contain letters, numbers, dashes and underscores. The bucket name is case sensitive.
<Highlight className="bash block">
  &gt; curl -X POST -d "mybucket" https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets
</Highlight>

<Spacer height={1} />
<h2 id="list-buckets">List your buckets</h2>
<EndpointLabel method="GET" path="/v1/buckets" />
You can list all of your buckets using the `GET` method on the `/buckets` endpoint.
<Highlight className="bash block">
  &gt; curl -X GET https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets
  [&#123; "name": "mybucket", "created": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z" &#125;]
</Highlight>

<h2 id="delete-buckets">Delete a bucket</h2>
<EndpointLabel method="DELETE" path="/v1/buckets/:bucketName" />
You can delete a bucket using the `DELETE` method on the `/buckets/:bucketName` endpoint. Deleting a bucket cannot be reversed, and will result in all of the associated keys being deleted as well. It is recommended that for any client side applications, API keys do not include the `delete:bucket` scope to avoid accidental deletion.

  &gt; curl -X DELETE https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets/mybucket

<h1 id="kvs">Key Values</h1>
<Spacer height={2} />

<h2 id="create-kv">Create or update a value</h2>
<EndpointLabel method="POST" path="/v1/kvs/:bucketName/:keyName" />
Key values are created or updated using the `POST` method on the `/kvs/:bucketName/:keyName` endpoint. The value string is passed in as the request body. 
If the key exists, the value will be updated. If the key does not exist, it will be created.
The key value must be unique within the bucket and can only contain letters, numbers, dashes and underscores. The key value is case sensitive. The data type of the value will be parsed and stored accordingly. For example if the value sent is "100", it will be stored and returned as an integer.
Return value is the key value string.
<Highlight className="bash block">
  &gt; curl -X POST -d "myvalue" https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets/myBucket/mykey
  "myvalue"
</Highlight>
<Spacer height={4} />
<hr />

<h2 id="create-kv">Increment/decrement a value</h2>
<EndpointLabel method="POST" path="/v1/kvs/:bucketName/:keyName" />
Number values can be incremented/decremented using the same endpoint as the create/update endpoint. To do this, pass in the value with a plus or minus sign before the amount you want to increment by. For example passing '+100' will increment the value by 100, or '-5' will decrement by 5.
<Highlight className="bash block">
  &gt; curl -X POST -d "100" https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets/myWebsite/hits
  100
  &gt; curl -X POST -d "+1" https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets/myWebsite/hits
  101

<h2 id="get-kv">Get a value</h2>
<EndpointLabel method="GET" path="/v1/kvs/:bucketName/:keyName" />
You can retrieve a key value using the `GET` method on the `/kvs/:bucketName/:keyName` endpoint.
<Highlight className="bash block">
  &gt; curl -X GET https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets/myWebsite/hits
  101

<h2 id="list-kv">List/search values</h2>
<EndpointLabel method="GET" path="/v1/kvs/:bucketName" />
You can list all of your key values using the `GET` method on the `/kvs/:bucketName` endpoint.
<Highlight className="bash block">
  &gt; curl -X GET https://kvpear.dev/v1/buckets/myBucket
  [&#123; "name": "mykey", "value": "myvalue", "created": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z" &#125;]
</Highlight>

You can provide additional query parameters to filter the results:
- `prefix`: *string* - only return key values that start with the prefix
- `regex`: *string* - only return key values that match the regex. The regex string must be URL encoded.

This can provide a powerful interface for other data-storage patterns such as using single-table design to store application data, for example.

You can delete a key-value pair using the `DELETE` method on the `/v1/kvs/:bucketName/:keyName` endpoint.
